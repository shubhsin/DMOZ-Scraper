##DMOZ Scraper
This is a scraper used to get all the URLs from [DMOZ](http://dmoz.org)

It recursively goes into each URL to get URLs from them. In this way we have all the URLs from DMOZ.

##Usage

To run the code you need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine.
You will need package requests. To install this -
`pip install requests`

You will need package BeautifulSoup. To install this -
`pip install beautifulsoup4`

Once the installation is done, go to the directory in which the python file is present and run 
`python scrapedmoz.py` on your terminal
Once it runs, just enter
`dmoz.org` when prompted and you would see all the URLs in your terminal.
